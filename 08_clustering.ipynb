    "\n",
    "The task of finding underlying coherent groups in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* hard clustering - assign each item to one cluster\n",
    "* soft clustering - degree of belonging to a cluster\n",
    "* hierarchical clustering - hierarchy of clusters, usually constructed bottom-to-top\n",
    "\n",
    "A nice comparison of the clustering algorithms and their results is [here](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html#clustering)\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the clustering algorithm, we might need:\n",
    "* a similarity metric on the items being clustered (function or matrix)\n",
    "* a way to establish cluster centres\n",
    "* a way to measure between cluster distance\n",
    "* a way to measure cluster coherence\n",
    "\n",
    "A notable difference between the algorithms is whether they can work with a matrix of pairwise similarities between arbitrary objects, or whether they need to be given a vector representation of the data items.\n",
    "\n",
    "## K-means\n",
    "\n",
    "The go-to clustering algorithm especially if your data is not badly violating its assumptions, and you have some idea about the number of clusters you'd like to obtain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Material: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html#k-means\n",
    "\n",
    "* Builds a single set of clusters\n",
    "* Explained in good detail on the lecture\n",

    "* http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html#hierarchical-clustering\n",
    "* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "* Builds nested clusters - cluster tree\n",
    "* Top: one cluster containing everything, bottom: one cluster for each document\n",
    "* Horizontal cut: one possible clustering of the data\n",

    "* Carrot2 document clustering engine \n",
    "* Builds on top of Solr - clusters search results\n",

    "* [LINGO algorithm](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.9.5370&rep=rep1&type=pdf)\n",
    "  * A bit too involved for the lecture, but in a nutshell:\n",
    "  * Choose common terms and phrases (filtering out stop-words)\n",
    "  * Find the most informative ones\n",
    "  * Match documents to these phrases\n",
    "  * Relies on a technique called SVD (Singular Value Decomposition)\n",
    "  * Note: reverses the typical approach of first clustering documents, then assigning labels to the clusters\n",
    "  * Here: labels exist first, then the clusters around them\n",
    "\n",
    "## Test Carrot2\n",
    "\n",
    "* Download Carrot2 Workbench\n",
    "* Point it to a running Solr\n",
    "    * Solr as source\n",
    "    * Correct URL\n",
    "    * Fill in field names\n",
    "    * Test with a query\n",
    "\n",
    "## Clustering inside Solr\n",
    "\n",
    "* Also perfectly doable\n",
    "* You need to configure it though, in the core's own config\n",
